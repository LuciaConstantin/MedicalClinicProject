## System presentation
- The main focus of the project is managing appointments between patients and doctors in a medical clinic. 
Patients can add, reschedule, view previous appointments, or plan a new one based on the availability of doctors.
- The system maintains information about doctors, their specialties, and the medical services they can perform. 
Each doctor has a personalized weekly schedule, and appointments are validated to ensure they fit within their working hours 
and do not overlap with existing bookings.
- Patients are categorized into different types: adults, children, or members, and each patient has a medical record that includes allergies and past diagnostics. 
After a consultation, the doctor can add a diagnostic and assign treatments, with checks to ensure medication does not conflict with known allergies.
- The clinic can also track financial data such as revenue from patients and identify the doctor who generated the most profit in the last year. 
- Various actions and queries are supported, from viewing a doctorâ€™s schedule to exploring available medical services by specialty.
